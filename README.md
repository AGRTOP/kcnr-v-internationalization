# kcnr-v-internationalization
- This repository houses all the language files for KCNR:V

# Rules

- Language keys must be sorted in alphabetical order (This does not affect the game, but allows us contributors to handle the keys more easily).
- %% is the insert placeholder, where the game shall replace %% with informational text, you MUST put these %% placeholders respectively back in place in the language that you are editing.
- All changes must be done via pull request and summary and description of what was done MUST be descriptive enough for English users to understand.
- Language files are in JSON format, they must STAY in JSON format.

## New languages

- Language files are stored as `language_code.json`.
- You may create new language files, they will not be automatically added to the game.
- When adding new language files, inform a developer at our [Discord Server](https://www.discord.me/kcnr) in order for it to be enabled in-game.
